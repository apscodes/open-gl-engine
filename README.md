# OpenGL Engine in C++

When I started this project, it started out as a blank console application in C++, apart from the initial test of printing "Hello World!" to screen. Before I wrote a single line of code for this, I planned out what features I would like it to have. I set goals to achieve them, but took away the systems that I didn't have time to complete with in the time frame I gave myself.


# Features:

 -  OBJ File Loading.
 -  Flying Camera with keyboard and mouse input controls.
-   Directional Lighting.
-   Render Targets.
-   GLSL Shader linking to objects.
-   No memory leaks. At this stage in the development for the engine.
